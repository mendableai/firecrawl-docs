## Scrape and extract structured data with Firecrawl

{/* <Warning>Scrape LLM Extract will be deprecated in future versions. Please use the new [Extract](/features/extract) endpoint.</Warning> */}

Firecrawl uses AI to get structured data from web pages in 3 steps:

1. **Set the Schema:**
   Tell us what data you want by defining a JSON schema (using OpenAI's format) along with the webpage URL.

2. **Make the Request:**
   Send your URL and schema to our scrape endpoint. See how here:
   [Scrape Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape)

3. **Get Your Data:**
   Get back clean, structured data matching your schema that you can use right away.

This makes getting web data in the format you need quick and easy.

## Extract structured data

### /scrape (with json) endpoint

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractPython />
<ExtractNode />
<ExtractCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ExtractOutput />

### Extracting without schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractNoSchemaCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ExtractNoSchemaOutput />

### JSON options object

The `jsonOptions` object accepts the following parameters:

- `schema`: The schema to use for the extraction.
- `systemPrompt`: The system prompt to use for the extraction.
- `prompt`: The prompt to use for the extraction without a schema.
